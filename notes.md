## Notes

Here are notes on some things I have thought about, sorted by subject. 
I feel that it is very easy to forget small things we learn in maths. 
Sometimes it can be a nuisance to track down specific statements in books, 
so it is useful to collect them in one place.

These are for personal uses only. 
I do not claim originality for the content of these notes.
