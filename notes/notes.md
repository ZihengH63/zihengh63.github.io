## Notes

Here are some notes on things I have thought about, sorted by subject. 
I feel that it is very easy to forget small things we learn in maths. 
Sometimes it can be nuisance to track down specific statement in books, 
so it is useful to collect them in one place.

These are for personal uses only. 
I do not claim originality for the content of these notes.
